"""Destructive-operation detection for execute_pyqgis code.

Runs on the QGIS side (in the socket worker thread) *before* any code reaches
the main-thread executor, so the approval gate applies no matter which subagent
issued the call — it is enforced at the bridge, never trusted to a prompt.

The scan is intentionally conservative: false positives cost one extra click,
false negatives risk data loss. AST first (robust), regex fallback for strings
the AST can't classify.
